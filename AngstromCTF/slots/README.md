## Solution write-up

When reading the python code, we see that the server only asks for an input and converts it to a float. When the amount of money left is 0 the connection is closed. Moreover, it is not a question of luck since we cannot actually win. The roulette will be relaunched as long as a winning output is given.


```python
while payout(line2):
    line2 = line()
```


Since the value has to be successfuly converted to a float and must not validate the check 
`if bet <= 0:`, I looked around to see what special values could be converted to float. I found that '-inf', '+inf' and 'Nan' worked. However, since the infinite values can be compared to other numbers, the checks wont be validated. But comparing 'Nan' and any other number will always return `False`, and we can get the flag with that.
